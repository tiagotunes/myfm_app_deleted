## To be done

- Add to database balance in Team table
- Maybe remove height and feet attributes of player
- In players body, add search bar and filter options
    - Search bar ignoring diacritics (รก -> a)
    - Default: not showing Loaned out players
- Check tutorials about how to use global variables (to use in currency options)

        birthdate TEXT NOT NULL,
